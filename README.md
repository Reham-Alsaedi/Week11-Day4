# Secure File Upload API üõ°Ô∏è

A secure and robust file upload backend built with ASP.NET Core Web API.  
This project demonstrates modern best practices for handling file uploads securely, including:

-  Multipart file upload
-  Antivirus scanning (simulated)
-  Asynchronous background processing
-  Upload status tracking
-  Rate limiting (in-memory)
-  Real-time UI updates via polling
- üñº Basic HTML frontend with progress feedback

---

##  Features

- **Secure Upload Endpoint:** Accepts image and document files using `multipart/form-data`.
- **Virus Detection Simulation:** Randomly detects "viruses" for demonstration purposes.
- **Async File Processing:** Files are queued and processed in the background using `Task.Run`.
- **Status Check Endpoint:** Track file processing status with a unique `uploadId`.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents rapid repeated uploads per client (in-memory).
- **Frontend:** Lightweight HTML+JS page with live polling and upload progress.
